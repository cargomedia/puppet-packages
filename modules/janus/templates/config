; NAT-related stuff: specifically, you can configure the STUN/TURN
; servers to use to gather candidates if the gateway is behind a NAT,
; and srflx/relay candidates are needed. In case STUN is not enough and
; this is needed (it shouldn't), you can also configure Janus to use a
; TURN server; please notice that this does NOT refer to TURN usage in
; browsers, but in the gathering of relay candidates by Janus itself,
; e.g., if you want to limit the ports used by a Janus instance on a
; private machine. Furthermore, you can choose whether Janus should be
; configured to work in ICE-Lite mode (by default it doesn't). Finally,
; you can also enable ICE-TCP support (beware that it currently *only*
; works if you enable ICE Lite as well), choose which interfaces should
; be used for gathering candidates, and enable or disable the
; internal libnice debugging, if needed.
