# You must be running a mongod process with built in SSL support. If

# Required only if connecting to MongoDBs running

#
# `sslTrustedServerCertificates` is path on disk that contains the trusted certificate
# authority certificates in PEM format. The certificates will be used to verify
# the server certificate returned from any MongoDBs running with SSL.
#
# Certificate verification can be turned off by changing the `sslRequireValidServerCertificates`
# field to False. That configuration is only recommended for testing purposes
# as it makes connections susceptible to MITM attacks.

# Kerberos settings
# krb5Principal: The Kerberos principal used by the agent, e.g. mmsagent/myhost@EXAMPLE.COM
# krb5Keytab: The ABSOLUTE path to kerberos principal's keytab file.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# 1) You have to set both of the following parameters to enable Kerberos authentication
#
# 2) Once you enable Kerberos for an agent, this agent can ONLY monitor MongoDB instances with
# Kerberos enabled. E.g., an agent cannot monitor 2 hosts where one of them has Kerberos enabled
# and another one does not have Kerberos.
#
# 3) The agent depends on 'kinit' to do the Kerberos authentication. And it looks for the executable
# in /usr/bin/kinit, so please make sure you have kinit in the locations.
